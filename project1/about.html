					<p alt="We provide affordable options for travel.">We are a small business travel agency that strives to bring the world of travel to people of all walks of life. To travel is to know one self. There is no shortage of places you can see and things to experience. Hopefully with our services you can experience as much of it as possible without breaking your bank account. Our staff is compromised of fifteen individuals and our stars are our travel agents. Our firm has four at the moment but are looking to expand our numbers. Our services are catered toward those who enjoy personalized attention in a professional manner. <br><br>WorldWide Travel Agency is a name we chose to signify what our business is all about. Too many companies try too hard with weird sounding names. What is a hulu for example? Or Reddit. Or GitHub or whatever else is out there. No, not us. Ours is simple. And don't even think about abbreviations that don't make any sense. I mean, we could go that route and say we're WWTA but that sounds like some kind of public transportation service or something. That's not going to work. How much filler text will make this look ok. I have no idea. Hope you're not reading into this too much. I'm just creating filler space for this project.</p>
